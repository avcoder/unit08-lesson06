# Recap

- Deployment to stores
1. Get a developer account:
   - Apple: $99 per year
   - Google: one time fee $25
   - business account: must provide proof
   - individual account: if you charge for your app, your personal address will be made public
- Recommendation: if you charge for your app (or even in-app purchases) use business account so you can use a PO box for your address
- Difference: Must pay $25 to Google when ready to deploy to stores vs Must pay $99 to Apple just to generate certificates to run on physical device
